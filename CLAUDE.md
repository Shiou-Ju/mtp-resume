# MTP Resume Project

## Overview
A CLI tool for smart MTP file transfer with resume capability, built to solve OpenMTP's limitations when transferring large amounts of files.

## Architecture
- Monorepo structure using pnpm workspaces
- Core logic separated from UI (CLI/GUI)
- SQLite for transfer state persistence

## Key Technologies
- Node.js with pnpm package manager
- better-sqlite3 for database operations
- commander.js for CLI interface
- cli-progress for progress display
- child_process for calling libmtp tools

## Development Guidelines
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Follow error-first callback pattern
- Keep TODO and FIXME comments intact
- Prefer functional programming approach where applicable

## File Structure
```
mtp-resume/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/        # Business logic
│   ├── cli/         # CLI interface
│   └── gui/         # Future GUI
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

## MTP Operations
We wrap libmtp command-line tools (mtp-detect, mtp-files, mtp-getfile) using child_process for MTP device access.

## Database Schema
Simple transfer tracking with file_path + file_size as unique identifier for resume capability.

## Development Commands

### Project Initialization
```bash
# Setup pnpm workspace
echo "packages:\n  - 'packages/*'" > pnpm-workspace.yaml

# Create package directories
mkdir -p packages/core/src packages/cli/src

# Initialize core package
cd packages/core && pnpm init
pnpm add better-sqlite3

# Initialize CLI package
cd ../cli && pnpm init
pnpm add commander chalk cli-progress
pnpm add -D @mtp-transfer/core@workspace:*
```

### Development & Testing
```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Build core package
pnpm --filter @mtp-transfer/core build

# Test CLI commands
pnpm --filter @mtp-transfer/cli dev

# Detect MTP device
mtp-transfer detect

# Transfer files
mtp-transfer transfer ~/Pictures/Phone

# Export transfer log
mtp-transfer export transfer-log.csv
```

### Testing MTP Commands
```bash
# Test MTP detection
mtp-detect

# List files on device
mtp-files

# Download specific file
mtp-getfile [file_id] [destination]
```

## Core Modules

### MTPWrapper (packages/core/src/mtp-wrapper.js)
- Wraps libmtp command-line tools
- Handles device detection and file operations
- Parses command output into structured data

### TransferManager (packages/core/src/transfer-manager.js)
- Manages transfer state and resume logic
- Handles batch operations and progress tracking
- Implements retry mechanisms for failed transfers

### TransferDatabase (packages/core/src/database.js)
- SQLite operations for transfer state
- Tracks file path, size, status, and errors
- Provides statistics and export functionality

## Development Workflow

### Starting New Features
```bash
claude
> Implement the pending files comparison logic in file-differ.js
```

### Debugging MTP Issues
```bash
claude
> /project:test-mtp
```

### Code Refactoring
```bash
claude
> Refactor the transfer-manager.js to improve error handling and add retry logic
```

### Documentation Generation
```bash
claude
> Generate JSDoc comments for all exported functions in the core package
```

## Git Commit Guidelines

### Conventional Commits Format
Follow the Conventional Commits specification for all commit messages:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body with main changes listed]
```

### Commit Types
- **feat**: A new feature or functionality was added
- **fix**: A bug or error was fixed
- **docs**: Changes were made to documentation
- **style**: Changes were made to code style, formatting, indentation, or whitespace
- **refactor**: Code was refactored without changing functionality
- **test**: Changes were made to test code
- **chore**: Changes to build process, configuration files, or non-code aspects

### Commit Message Best Practices
- **Keep messages concise**: Use short, clear descriptions in Traditional Chinese
- **List main changes first**: After the summary line, list important changes for quick understanding
- **Consistent syntax**: Start each change item with a verb (e.g., "新增...", "更新...", "修復...")
- **Use Traditional Chinese**: All commit messages should be in Traditional Chinese, technical terms can remain in English
- **Avoid verbose explanations**: Focus on what changed, not why or how

### Example Commit Messages

## Development Workflow with Testing

### Phase-by-Phase Development
Each development phase should include comprehensive testing before moving to the next phase:

#### Phase 1: Foundation Testing
```bash
# After implementing monorepo structure
pnpm install                    # Verify workspace setup
pnpm --filter @mtp-transfer/core build  # Test core package build
pnpm --filter @mtp-transfer/cli dev     # Test CLI package setup

# Database module testing
node -e "const db = require('./packages/core/src/database.js'); console.log('Database module loads correctly')"
```

#### Phase 2: Core Functionality Testing
```bash
# MTP operations testing (requires real device or mock)
node -e "const MTP = require('./packages/core/src/mtp-wrapper.js'); console.log('MTP wrapper loads correctly')"

# File comparison testing
node -e "const differ = require('./packages/core/src/file-differ.js'); console.log('File differ loads correctly')"

# Integration testing
node -e "const manager = require('./packages/core/src/transfer-manager.js'); console.log('Transfer manager loads correctly')"
```

#### Phase 3: CLI Testing
```bash
# Command execution testing
./packages/cli/src/index.js --help
./packages/cli/src/index.js detect --dry-run
./packages/cli/src/index.js transfer --help

# Progress display testing
./packages/cli/src/index.js transfer /tmp/test --mock-mode
```

#### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing
```bash
# Full workflow testing
pnpm test                       # Run all unit tests
pnpm test:integration          # Run integration tests
pnpm build                     # Verify build process
./packages/cli/src/index.js doctor  # System diagnostic
```

### PR Testing Requirements

Before creating a PR for each issue:

```bash
# Standard pre-PR checklist
git status                     # Ensure clean working directory
pnpm install                   # Verify dependencies
pnpm lint                      # Code style check
pnpm test                      # Run test suite
pnpm build                     # Verify build process

# Issue-specific testing (run the commands from the phase testing above)
```

### Mock Testing Strategy

For testing without real MTP devices:

```bash
# Create mock MTP responses
export MTP_MOCK_MODE=true

# Test with mock data
./packages/cli/src/index.js detect
./packages/cli/src/index.js transfer /tmp/mock-dest --dry-run
```

## Security Guidelines

### Docker Development Environment
This project uses Docker for safe development and testing:

```bash
# Safe commands - isolated in containers
./scripts/dev-docker.sh test     # Syntax checks in container
./scripts/dev-docker.sh build    # Build development image
./scripts/dev-docker.sh install  # Install dependencies safely
./scripts/dev-docker.sh shell    # Interactive development
./scripts/dev-docker.sh status   # Show container status
```

### Security Restrictions
**CRITICAL**: The following commands are PROHIBITED for security:
- ❌ `docker rm` / `docker rmi` - No deletion of containers/images
- ❌ `rm -rf` / `rmdir` - No file system deletion
- ❌ `docker system prune` - No system cleanup
- ❌ `sudo` commands - No privilege escalation
- ❌ `--rm` flags - No auto-removal containers

### Security Confirmation Policy
**When in doubt about security implications:**
1. **ALWAYS ask user for explicit confirmation** before:
   - Installing new npm packages with native components
   - Running commands that could affect the host system
   - Executing unfamiliar system commands
   - Making network requests to external services

2. **Provide clear risk assessment:**
   - What the command does
   - What system resources it accesses
   - Potential security implications
   - Recommended safer alternatives

3. **Use Docker isolation when possible:**
   - Prefer container-based testing over host execution
   - Use read-only mounts when appropriate
   - Test with mock data instead of real devices

### Example Security Check
```bash
# Before running this command, ask user:
# "This will install better-sqlite3 (native module) - confirm? (y/n)"
pnpm install better-sqlite3
```

## Best Practices

- **Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding**: Don't move to next phase until current phase tests pass
- **Write tests alongside code**: Each feature should include its tests
- **Use mock data for CI/CD**: Ensure tests can run without real MTP devices
- **Validate CLI usability**: Test commands with actual user scenarios
- **Security first**: Use Docker containers for all testing and development
- **Ask for confirmation**: When security implications are unclear, always ask user
- Provide clear test cases for Claude to validate against
- Use `/project:` commands for predefined workflows
- Keep CLAUDE.md updated with latest architecture changes
- Save common workflows as command templates in `.claude/commands/`
- Test MTP operations with actual devices when possible
- Handle graceful degradation when MTP tools are unavailable
- Follow Conventional Commits format for all commits
- Always check git status before committing to ensure clean working directory
